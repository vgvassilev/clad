    - title: "Cling for live coding music and musical instruments"
      speaker: "Jack Armitage, Intelligent Instruments Lab"
      description: |
        The artistic live coding community has been growing steadily since
        around the year 2000. The Temporary Organisation for the Permanence of
        Live Art Programming (TOPLAP) has been around since 2004, Algorave
        (algorithmic rave parties) recently celebrated its tenth birthday, and
        six editions of the International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC) have
        been held. A great many live coding systems have been developed during
        this time, many of them exhibiting exotic and culturally specific
        features that professional software developers are mostly unaware of.
        This talk will introduce the artistic live coding context and
        community, and then describe attempts by this community to appropriate
        the Cling C++ interpreter for artistic practice. In one such example,
        Cling has been used as the basis for a C++ based live coding
        synthesiser [1]. In another example, Cling has been installed on a
        BeagleBoard to bring live coding to the Bela interactive audio
        platform [2]. Following these examples, I will offer some reflections
        on the potential mutual benefits for increased engagement between the
        Cling community and the artistic live coding community.

    - title: "ez-clang: experimental C++ REPL for bare metal"
      speaker: "Stefan Gränitz, LLVM Orc JIT developer"
      description: |
        In 2021 a new remote-JIT layer "RemoteEPC" landed in LLVM's OrcJIT
        library [0]. It separates serialization from transport, streamlines
        error behavior and integrates well with ExecutorProcessControl. Combined
        with the clean design  and extensibility of ORCv2 and JITLink, it lowers
        the bar for building exotic out-of-process LLVM bitcode JITs.

        The ez-clang project [1] makes use of all these to build a pure
        out-of-process REPL specifically designed for very low-resource embedded
        devices. The executor endpoint on the device is very simple and fits
        into a few Kilobytes of memory. All heavy lifting happens in the JIT
        process on the host.

        I want to present my proof-of-concept implementation, which is based on
        a hacked-up version of cling [2] (bringing in Clang-integration, a
        command line and the concept of transaction-based incremental
        compilation). Right now, it supports a small selection of Cortex-M
        development boards. The smallest is the TeensyLC [3] with an ARMv6-M
        instruction set, 62kb Flash memory and 8kb RAM.

    - title: "Proposal for a C++ Language Interoperability Layer"
      speaker: "Vassil Vassilev, Princeton"
      description: |
        The C++ programming language is used for many numerically intensive
        scientific applications. A combination of performance and solid backward
        compatibility has led to its use for many research software codes over
        the past 20 years. Despite its power, C++ is often seen as difficult to
        learn and inconsistent with rapid application development. Exploration
        and prototyping is slowed down by the long edit-compile-run cycles
        during development. Exploratory programming is an effective way to gain
        a deeper understanding of a project's requirements; reduce the
        complexity of a problem; and provide an early validation of the system’s
        design and implementation. This is amongst the strengths of Python and a
        major design goal of new languages such as Julia, D and Swift.

        Two of the most widely used languages by researchers are C++ and Python.
        Python has grown steadily as a language of choice for data science and
        application control. The interactive nature of Python and its many
        available libraries make it an excellent choice for scripting tasks and
        code prototyping. However, native computational performance of Python is
        mediocre. Python includes functionality for replacing the most critical
        components of a processing kernel with implementations in C. This
        functionality is insufficient to fully cover many scientific use cases
        because crossing the language boundary is expensive due to limitations
        in current tools.

        This talk describes key aspects of language interoperability for C++
        using an automated binding approach. The primary initial focus is to
        support automatic binding to and from Python. Furthermore, the approach
        is generic enough to fit other languages such as D and Julia.

    - title: "Cppyy"
      speaker: "Wim Lavrijsen, LBL"
      description: |
        cppyy provides automatic Python bindings to C++ code, at runtime,
        through Cling, the C++ interpreter. Python is itself a dynamic language
        executed by an interpreter, thus the interaction with C++ code becomes
        more natural when intermediated by Cling. Examples include runtime
        template instantiations, callbacks, cross-language inheritance,
        automatic downcasting, and exception mapping. Many advanced C++ features
        such as placement new, multiple virtual inheritance, variadic templates,
        etc., are also naturally handled.

        cppyy achieves high performance through an all-lazy approach and
        specialization of common cases through runtime reflection. As such, it
        has a much lower call overhead than other binders, notably in its
        implementation for PyPy, a fully compatible Python interpreter sporting
        a tracing JIT. Furthermore, cppyy makes maintaining a large software
        stack simpler: except for cppyy’s own python-interpreter binding, it
        does not have any compiled code that is Python-dependent. I.e.,
        cppyy-based extension modules require no recompilation when switching
        Python interpreters.

        In this presentation I'll show the benefits of runtime Python-C++
        bindings and give a bird's eye overview of the implementation
        underpinning cppyy.

      speaker: "Keno Fischer, JuliaComputing"
      description: |
        Cxx.jl is one of the oldest Julia packages and provides extremely tight
        integration between Julia and C++. With advanced features including a
        C++, REPL environment, the ability to perform cross-language template
        instantiation as well as cross-language object implementation, it is a
        powerful tool for developers seeking to integrate the two languages.
        However, despite these capabilities, the package never fully became
        mainstream due to a number of technical limitations. In this talk, I
        will explore the design and featureset of Cxx.jl, and what limitations
        in Clang and Julia prevented its full adoption in the Julia world.

      description: |
        LLVM’s On Request Compilation (ORC) APIs provide a foundation for
        building in-memory and just-in-time compilers by re-using existing
        static compilers. This re-use is enabled by appending a new linking
        step to the standard compiler pipeline to patch the compiler output into
        the executing process. The ORC APIs support concurrent compilation, lazy
        compilation, and linking of code across process boundaries and even
        across architectures. The ORC APIs are already used in several open
        source projects including PostgreSQL, Cling, Julia, and the Swift
        interpreter; and they remain under active development with new features
        added frequently. This talk will provide an overview of the ORC APIs and
        recent developments, as well as demos and pointers to example code.
