- title: Cling–the new interactive interpreter for ROOT 6
  author: V Vassilev, Ph Canal, A Naumann, P Russo
  abstract: |
    Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of Clang and LLVM
    compiler infrastructure. Like its predecessor Cint, Cling realizes the
    read-print-evaluate-loop concept, in order to leverage rapid application
    development. Implemented as a small extension to LLVM and Clang, the
    interpreter reuses their strengths such as the praised concise and expressive
    compiler diagnostics. We show how to match the interpreter concept to the
    compiler library and generalize common set of requirements for building up
    an interactive interpreter. We reason the design and implementation
    decisions as solution to the challenge of implementing interpreter behaviour
    as an extension of the compiler library. We present the new features, eg
    how C++11 will come to Cling and how CINT-specific extensions are being
    adopted. We clarify the state of integration in the ROOT framework and the
    induced change set. We explain how ROOT ...

- title: Clad—automatic differentiation using Clang and LLVM
  author: V Vassilev, M Vassilev, A Penev, L Moneta, V Ilieva
  abstract: |
   Differentiation is ubiquitous in high energy physics, for instance in
   minimization algorithms and statistical analysis, in detector alignment and
   calibration, and in theory. Automatic differentiation (AD) avoids well-known
   limitations in round-offs and speed, which symbolic and numerical
   differentiation suffer from, by transforming the source code of functions. We
   will present how AD can be used to compute the gradient of multi-variate
   functions and functor objects. We will explain approaches to implement an AD
   tool. We will show how LLVM, Clang and Cling (ROOT's C++ 11 interpreter)
   simplifies creation of such a tool. We describe how the tool could be
   integrated within any framework. We will demonstrate a simple proof-of-concept
   prototype, called Clad, which is able to generate n-th order derivatives of
   C++ functions and other language constructs. We also demonstrate how Clad can
   offload laborious computations ...

- title: Optimizing ROOT’s Performance Using C++ Modules
  author: V Vassilev
  abstract: |
    ROOT comes with a C++ compliant interpreter cling. Cling needs to understand
    the content of the libraries in order to interact with them. Exposing the
    full shared library descriptors to the interpreter at runtime translates
    into increased memory footprint. ROOT’s exploratory programming concepts
    allow implicit and explicit runtime shared library loading. It requires the
    interpreter to load the library descriptor. Re-parsing of descriptors’
    content has a noticeable effect on the runtime performance. Present
    state-of-art lazy parsing technique brings the runtime performance to
    reasonable levels but proves to be fragile and can introduce correctness
    issues. An elegant solution is to load information from the descriptor lazily
    and in a non-recursive way.The LLVM community advances its C++ Modules
    technology providing an io-efficient, on-disk representation capable to
    reduce build times and peak memory usage. The feature ...

- title: Optimizing Frameworks’ Performance Using C++ Modules Aware ROOT
  author: Y Takahashi, V Vassilev, O Shadura, R Isemann
  abstract: |
    ROOT is a data analysis framework broadly used in and outside of High Energy
    Physics (HEP). Since HEP software frameworks always strive for performance
    improvements, ROOT was extended with experimental support of runtime C++
    Modules. C++ Modules are designed to improve the performance of C++ code
    parsing. C++ Modules offers a promising way to improve ROOT’s runtime
    performance by saving the C++ header parsing time which happens during ROOT
    runtime. This paper presents the results and challenges of integrating C++
    Modules into ROOT.

- title: GPU Accelerated Automatic Differentiation With Clad
  author: Ioana Ifrim, Vassil Vassilev, David J Lange 
  abstract: |
    Automatic Differentiation (AD) is instrumental for science and industry. 
    It is a tool to evaluate the derivative of a function specified through a 
    computer program. The range of AD application domain spans from Machine 
    Learning to Robotics to High Energy Physics. Computing gradients with 
    the help of AD is guaranteed to be more precise than the numerical 
    alternative and have a low, constant factor more arithmetical operations 
    compared to the original function. Moreover, AD applications to domain 
    problems typically are computationally bound. They are often limited by 
    the computational requirements of high-dimensional parameters and thus can
    benefit from parallel implementations on graphics processing units (GPUs). 
    Clad aims to enable differential analysis for C/C++ and CUDA and is a 
    compiler-assisted AD tool available both as a compiler extension and in ROOT. 
    Moreover, Clad works as a plugin extending the Clang compiler; as a plugin 
    extending the interactive interpreter Cling; and as a Jupyter kernel 
    extension based on xeus-cling. We demonstrate the advantages of parallel 
    gradient computations on GPUs with Clad. We explain how to bring forth a new 
    layer of optimization and a proportional speed up by extending Clad to 
    support CUDA. The gradients of well-behaved C++ functions can be 
    automatically executed on a GPU. The library can be easily integrated into 
    existing frameworks or used interactively. Furthermore, we demonstrate the 
    achieved application performance improvements, including (~10x) in ROOT 
    histogram fitting and corresponding performance gains from offloading to GPUs.

- title: Automatic Differentiation in ROOT
  author: Vassil Vassilev, Aleksandr Efremov, Oksana Shadura
  abstract: |
    In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD) is
    a set of techniques to evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a
    computer program. AD exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter
    how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations
    (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.), elementary functions
    (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.) and control flow statements. AD takes source code
    of a function as input and produces source code of the derived function. By
    applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of
    arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working
    precision, and using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic
    operations than the original program.This paper presents AD techniques
    available in ROOT, supported by Cling, to produce derivatives of arbitrary
    C/C++ functions through implementing source code transformation and
    employing the chain rule of differential calculus in both forward mode and
    reverse mode. We explain its current integration for gradient computation in
    TFormula. We demonstrate the correctness and performance improvements in
    ROOT's fitting algorithms.

    The high energy physics community is discussing where investment is needed
    to prepare software for the HL-LHC and its unprecedented challenges. The ROOT
    project is one of the central software players in high energy physics since
    decades. From its experience and expectations, the ROOT team has distilled a
    comprehensive set of areas that should see research and development in the
    context of data analysis software, for making best use of HL-LHC's physics
    potential. This work shows what these areas could be, why the ROOT team
    believes investing in them is needed, which gains are expected, and where
    related work is ongoing. It can serve as an indication for future research
    proposals and cooperations.

  abstract: |
    C++ Modules come in C++ 20 to fix the long-standing build scalability
    problems in the language. They provide an io-efficient, on-disk
    representation capable to reduce build times and peak memory usage. ROOT
    employs the C++ modules technology further in the ROOT dictionary system to
    improve its performance and reduce the memory footprint.ROOT with C++ Modules
    was released as a technology preview in fall 2018, after intensive
    development during the last few years. The current state is ready for
    production, however, there is still room for performance optimizations. In
    this talk, we show the roadmap for making the technology default in ROOT.
    We demonstrate a global module indexing optimization which allows reducing
    the memory footprint dramatically for many workflows. We will report user
    feedback on the migration to ROOT with C++ Modules.

- title: Migrating large codebases to C++ Modules
  author: Yuka Takahashi, Oksana Shadura, Vassil Vassilev
  abstract: |
    ROOT has several features which interact with libraries and require implicit
    header inclusion. This can be triggered by reading or writing data on disk,
    or user actions at the prompt. Often, the headers are immutable, and
    reparsing is redundant. C++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing
    of the same header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation
    of C++ Code. ROOT has released a C++ Modules-aware technology preview, which
    intends to become the default for the ROOT 6.20 release.

- title: IDD – A Platform Enabling Differential Debugging
  author: Martin Vassilev, Vassil Vassilev, Alexander Penev
  abstract: |
    Debugging is a very time consuming task which is not well supported by
    existing tools. The existing methods do not provide tools enabling optimal
    developers' productivity when debugging regressions in complex systems. In
    this paper we describe a possible solution aiding differential debugging.
    The differential debugging technique performs analysis of the regressed
    system and identifying the cause of the unexpected behavior by comparing to
    a previous version of the same system. The prototype, idd, inspects two
    versions of the executable – a baseline and a regressed version. The
    interactive debugging session runs side by side both executables and allows
    to examine and to compare various internal states. The architecture can work
    with multiple information sources comparing data from different tools. We
    also show how idd can detect performance regressions using information from
    third-party performance facilities. We illustrate how in practice we can
    quickly discover regressions in large systems such as the clang compiler.

- title: Relaxing the one definition rule in interpreted C++
  author: Javier López-Gómez, Javier Fernández, David del Rio Astorga, Vassil
    Vassilev, Axel Naumann, J Daniel García
  abstract: |
    Most implementations of the C++ programming language generate binary
    executable code. However, interpreted execution of C++ sources has its own
    use cases as the Cling interpreter from CERN's ROOT project has shown. Some
    limitations are derived from the ODR (One Definition Rule) that rules out
    multiple definitions of entities within a single translation unit (TU). ODR
    is there to ensure uniform view of a given C++ entity across translation
    units. Ensuring uniform view of C++ entities helps when producing ABI
    compatible binaries. Interpreting C++ presumes a single ever-growing
    translation unit that define away some of the ODR use-cases. Therefore, it
    may well be desirable to relax the ODR and, consequently, to support the
    ability of developers to override any existing definition for a given
    declaration. This approach is especially well-suited for iterative
    prototyping. In this paper, we extend Cling, a Clang/LLVM ...

    Duka, Vinod Grover
  abstract: |
    Derivatives are vital a wide variety of computing applications, including
    numerical optimization, solution of nonlinear equations, sensitivity
    analysis, and nonlinear inverse problems. Virtually every process could be
    described with a mathematical function. A mathematical function can be
    thought of as an association between elements from different sets.
    Derivatives can track how a varying quantity depends on another quantity,
    for example how the position of a planet as the time varies. Derivatives and
    gradients allows us to explore the properties of a function and thus the
    described process as a whole. Also, gradients are an essential component in
    gradient-based optimization methods, that have become more and more important
    in recent years, in particular with its application training of (Deep) Neural
    Networks. Derivatives can be computed numerically, but unfortunately the
    finite differences methods are problematic due to the approximation operated
    and the finite precision of floating point values used, and so the
    implementation of the method faces precision and round off problems which
    can affect the overall precision of the computation. This problem becomes
    worse with higher order derivatives.

    Foundational software libraries such as ROOT are under intense pressure to
    avoid software regression, including performance regressions. Continuous
    performance benchmarking, as a part of continuous integration and other code
    quality testing, is an industry best-practice to understand how the performance
    of a software product evolves. We present a framework, built from industry best
    practices and tools, to help to understand ROOT code performance and monitor
    the efficiency of the code for several processor architectures. It additionally
    allows historical performance measurements for ROOT I/O, vectorization and
    parallelization sub-systems.

  abstract: |
    The ROOT software framework is foundational for the HEP ecosystem, providing
    multiple capabilities such as I/O, a C++ interpreter, GUI, and math
    libraries. It uses object-oriented concepts and build-time components to
    layer between them. We believe that a new layering formalism will benefit
    the ROOT user community. We present the modularization strategy for ROOT
    which aims to build upon the existing source components, making available
    the dependencies and other metadata outside of the build system, and allow
    post-install additions on top of existing installation as well as in the ROOT
    runtime environment. Components can be grouped into packages and made
    available from repositories in order to provide a post-install step of
    missing packages. This feature implements a mechanism for the more
    comprehensive software ecosystem and makes it available even from a minimal
    ROOT installation. As part of ...

    with machine precision accuracy through a method called automatic
