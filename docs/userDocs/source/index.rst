Clad: Automatic differentiation plugin for C++
===============================================

Release v\ |version|.

Overview
------------

Clad enables 
`automatic differentiation (AD) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation>`_
for C++. It is based on LLVM compiler infrastructure and is a plugin for 
`Clang compiler <http://clang.llvm.org/>`_. Clad is based on source code 
transformation. Given C++ source code of a mathematical function, it can
automatically generate C++ code for computing derivatives of the function.
It supports both forward-mode and reverse-mode AD. 

Automatic differentiation solves all the usual problems of numerical differentiation (precision loss) 
and symbolic differentiation (inefficient code produced). If you are just getting
started with clad, then please checkout
:doc:`Getting started with clad <user/gettingStarted>` and
:doc:`Tutorials <user/tutorials>`.

----------------------

Clad example use::

   #include "clad/Differentiator/Differentiator.h"
   #include <iostream>

   double f(double x, double y) { return x * y; }

   int main() {
     auto f_dx = clad::differentiate(f, "x");
     // computes derivative of 'f' when (x, y) = (3, 4) and prints it.
     std::cout << f_dx.execute(3, 4) << std::endl; // prints: 4
     f_dx.dump(); // prints:
     /* double f_darg0(double x, double y) {
         double _d_x = 1; double _d_y = 0;
          return _d_x * y + x * _d_y;
        } */
   }

Features
-----------

- Requires little to no code modification for computing derivatives of existing codebase.
- Features both reverse mode AD (backpropagation) and forward mode AD.
- Computes derivatives of functions, member functions, functors and lambda expressions.
- Supports large subset of C++ including if statements, for, while loops and so
  much more; it is actively being developed with the goal of supporting all of 
  C++ syntax.
- Provides direct functions for computation of Hessian matrix and Jacobian matrix.
- Supports array differentiation, that is, it can differentiate either with 
  respect to whole arrays or particular indices of the array.
- Features numerical differentiation support, to be used as a fallback where 
  automatic differentiation is not feasible.
